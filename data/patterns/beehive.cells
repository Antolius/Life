!Name: Beehive
!Author: John Conway
!Description: Beehive is a 6-cell still life, one of the first objects found. Beehives are frequently born in a set of four called honey farm. It is possible to turn a single beehive into one by adding a corner, a cell to the "tip" of it or inside it. A beehive can be eaten with a block, a reaction that allows the construction of the queen bee shuttle and further patterns based on it.
