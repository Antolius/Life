!Name: Blinker
!Author: John Conway
!Description: The blinker is the smallest and most common oscillator. It is one of only a handful of known oscillators that is a polyomino (pattern of orthogonally connected cells), and it is the only known finite oscillator that is one cell thick. Blinkers are very commonly formed in a set of four called the traffic light. When phased correctly and positioned next to other evolving patterns blinkers can stabilize their behaviors without connecting to them.
!Pattern type: Oscillator
